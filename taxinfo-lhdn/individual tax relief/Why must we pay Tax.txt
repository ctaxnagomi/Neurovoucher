Why must we pay Tax?
Revenue is used by the government to govern and manage Malaysia and its development expenditure.

The Government allocates and spends tax collections for the purpose of national security, physical development and infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, schools as well as economic and social development such as health services, education and welfare of the people.
