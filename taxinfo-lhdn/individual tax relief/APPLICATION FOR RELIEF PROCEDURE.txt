APPLICATION FOR RELIEF PROCEDURE

An application for relief can be made either by a letter or through prescribed forms by stating the reasons in detail relating to the application. The forms for application for relief can be downloaded and printed from the following link:
CP15C – Form for Application for Relief to the DGIR under Paragraph 97A(5)(a) / Subsection 131(1) of the ITA
CP15F – Form for Application for Relief to the DGIR under Paragraph 97A(5)(b) / Subsection 131A(1) of the ITA
In the event the letter or the form is not filled with the correct details, the application shall be returned to the taxpayer to enable the taxpayer to submit a new application for relief.
If the application for relief is approved by the DGIR, the assessment will be amended and a reduced assessment will be issued.
If the application for relief is rejected by the DGIR, a rejection letter together with the grounds of rejection will be issued to the taxpayer.
If the taxpayer disagrees with the decision of the DGIR, within six (6) months from the date of the rejection letter, the taxpayer may via a letter request the DGIR to send the application for relief (which has been submitted earlier) to the SCIT. The DGIR shall forward the application to the SCIT within three (3) months from the date of receipt of the request. An example of the Taxpayer Request Letter can be downloaded from the following link: Example of the Taxpayer Request Letter
In a case where a deemed assessment on an ITRF or an amended ITRF is made in accordance with a known stand, rules and practices of the DGIR prevailing at the time the assessment was made, the taxpayer's application for relief under subsections 97A and 131 of the ITA for an error or mistake will not be considered even though the taxpayer can prove that there is an error or mistake unless the error is only arithmetical or computational.
